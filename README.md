# LeafAI - Cinematic Plant Disease Diagnostic Engine

LeafAI is an enterprise-grade, full-stack web application designed to detect plant diseases from leaf images with high precision. Built to demonstrate flagship-level UX/UI, the application bridges advanced generative AI (Google Gemini Vision) with fluid, cinematic frontend architecture.

##  Key Features

###  Enterprise Frontend & Cinematic UX
*   **Glassmorphic Bento Grid:** Dynamic, responsive masonry layout using `react-tilt` for 3D card physics and fluid CSS grid architecture.
*   **Deep-Scan HUD Animation:** Custom CSS keyframe animations simulating a robotic vision/laser scan over the uploaded image.
*   **WebGL Particle Physics:** Context-aware background particles (`react-tsparticles`) that change color, speed, and density based on the AI's severity assessment.
*   **Fluid Motion & Transitions:** Smooth layout animations and skeleton loaders powered by `framer-motion`.
*   **Dark/Light Mode:** Full CSS variable-based theming with automatic contrast adjustments.

### Advanced AI Backend
*   **Multimodal Inference:** Utilizes `gemini-2.5-flash` to process image buffers and return structured JSON diagnostics (prediction, confidence score, summary, and treatments).
*   **Botanist AI Copilot:** A built-in, context-aware chat sidebar that allows users to ask follow-up questions about the diagnosed disease (e.g., "Can I use neem oil for this?").
*   **Streamlined Express API:** Handles `multipart/form-data` via Multer, processing images entirely in memory/temp storage before sending payloads to the AI model.

##  Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
*   Express/Node


### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/leaf-ai.git](https://github.com/yourusername/leaf-ai.git)
cd leaf-ai
2. Backend Setup
Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory:
```
```Bash
cd backend
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend folder and add your Gemini API key:

Code snippet
PORT=5000
Start the backend server:
```
```Bash
npm run dev
# Server should output: 🚀 Server running on http://localhost:5000
3. Frontend Setup
Open a second terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
```
```Bash
cd frontend
npm install
Start the React development server:
```
```Bash
npm start
# App will launch on http://localhost:3000
```

📂 API Endpoints
POST /predict
